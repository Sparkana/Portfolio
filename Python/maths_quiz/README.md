Originally created for coursework in year 11, recreated in Year 1 of University.

Scenario:
Create a program that asks students to complete 10 mathematical questions from addition, subtraction and multiplication. These scores should be saved with the student's name, their class, and the student's previous 2 scores (if they exist) into a file for later use. A teacher should then be able to get those scores back through the program, and be able to view them alphabetically, by highest score and by the average of the last 3 scores.

Program description:
A single file python program, who's primary function is to ask 10 addition, subtraction and multiplication questions, and save those scores with the user's name into a .csv file named after their class. A teacher can then access a section of the program with a password, which will allow them to get the data of a particular class back in one of the 3 mentioned ways.
